Personal Portfolio for Phone Pyae Maung @ Min Pyae Bo

Brief Introduction(will keep it very brief)
    Greetings, I am Phone Pyae Maung @ Min Pyae Bo, nickname either Bo Bo or Bryan. I have no preferences.
    I am Burmese/Myanmar and always had an innate interest in Video Games and Programming.
    Below are a run through of the folders and the projects part of it, either personal hobby or from jobs.

Folder 1: Realm Com Revamp
            My personal Warcraft 3 Modding project Realm Com Revamp. Source File as well as code for it. Not the best but it's something I do for a hobby.
            But it is something I am proud of and if you don't have Warcraft 3 you can still see the code files for it in the same folder.
            As Warcraft 3 mods usually use both Coding and GUI, I have elected to only show the Coded systems that I made. Currently discontinued due to schoolwork.

Folder 2: Unamed Godot Project
            Ongoing project in Godot which follows a hybrid 4X, turn based style. Very early in progress. Still ongoing but slow progress due to schoolwork.

Folder 3: HOI4 Designs Collection
            A collection of designs for scenarios or other tidbits I have done for the Hoi4 Mod Teams

Folder 4: ???
