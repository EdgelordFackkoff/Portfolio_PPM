This is a constantly updated mod I am still working on for Warcraft 3.
This is more a hobby of mine but has been the location of some of my best coding experiences.

4SgtWinter_BloodRiver(RW) is a Warcraft 3 map that requires Warcraft 3 to play or edit/view like an editor.
As such I have several little txt files of the code that are part of it.
